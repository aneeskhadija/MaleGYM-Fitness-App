    <string name="diet_steps_description">Even if you follow every step of the workout plan to the letter,
        you wont see the results you want if you are not backing up your work in the gym in the kitchen.
        The obvious first steps are to cut down on fast food, takeaways and booze,
        and after that its all about getting your body the nutrients it needs to stay healthy and support your training regime. \n\n
        A minimum of five portions of fruit and vegetables a day is a good place to start.
        More than that is even better, although keep your daily fruit portions to two.
        You should also ensure you are getting 30g of fibre every day.
        Opt for wholegrain varieties where possible with your carbs to help on the fibre front. \n\n
        Adequate protein intake is also essential, because it provides the fuel you need to repair and rebuild muscles after a tough workout.
        When training regularly you should aim to consume about 1.4-2g of protein per kilo of bodyweight per day.
        You can use protein powder to help, but its not hard (and much tastier) to get that amount of protein from food if you are eating the right stuff.
        This guide to the best sources of protein will help, as will these run-downs of high-protein foods for vegetarians and vegans. \n\n
        If it all sounds like too much work when you are visiting the gym four times a week,
        another option is to use a healthy meal delivery service.
        These will deliver meals to your door that are tailored to your exact requirements,
        so all you have to do is stick them in the microwave. Its more expensive than meal planning and cooking for yourself,
        but less expensive than a Deliveroo habit – and its undoubtedly the most convenient
        way to support this training plan if you are struggling to maintain a healthy diet. \n
